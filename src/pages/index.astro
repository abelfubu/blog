          I'm a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally
          designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I'm focused on
          building accessible, human-centered products at Wolters Kluwer

        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          Hello! My name is Abel and I enjoy creating things that live on the
          internet. My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I
          decided to try editing Wordpress sites — turns out hacking together a
          custom site taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
          variety of clients.
